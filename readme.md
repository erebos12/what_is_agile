# What Agile NOT is !

## SCUM != Agile

- SCRUM is a process, Agile is a culture!

  - **Culture Eats Process for Breakfast**
  - So when you have a NON-Agile culture, then the processes doesn't matter that much.

- It's very hard to transform a company into an Agile organization. That's why you rarly see REAL agile companies. One result was this Anti-Pattern called "_Water-Scrum-Fall_" (Quasi-Standard in most Industries):

# So what is Agile then?

**IT'S A CULTURE BASED ON TRUST, RESPECT & COURAGE!!!**

When you live these values, then you can be agile as an organization. Follow these principles:

- Agility affects the entire organization. (not only IT) - It's holistic!
- The teams (all teams) define processes and tools, not the management
- Management acts as a servant
- Its adaptive, not predictive. Estimates are predictive.
- Nobody is ordering around somebody. (Self-organized teams)
- You embrace uncertainties und adapt to change. In the entire organization!
- You follow the rule "Compass-Over-Map"
- Every decision is value-driven, not time or cost-driven.
- Results are open-ended. You cannot plan them!

The core values and principles are defined in the "Manifesto for Agile Software-Development" - https://agilemanifesto.org/

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Let those who do the work design their own working processes.
  - Respect people’s expertise — they are the right ones to improve and change their workflows. (**TRUST & RESPECT**)
  - Self-organized (autonomous) teams → no need for a project manager anymore!
  - Teams decide independently which process they follow. For example, one team might use XP, another Scrum, and a third Kanban.

- Very often, processes are defined by others (external experts, management, etc.) on paper. That is **not** agile! Let the people define the processes they work within — they know best what can be improved.

- Management should act as a supporter or servant, not as a commander. Let people do their job while management focuses on creating the best possible work environment. The main responsibility of management is to remove any kind of obstacles.


## Working software over comprehensive documentation

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Don't document progress by excel sheets, traffic lights / percentages on slides or other documents.
- "Doing is better than knowing!"
- After all, the working software is the reason for the project.
- With agile approaches, project teams spend more time on development and less time on documentation, resulting in a more efficient delivery of a working product.

### TIP:

_Stop producing a document and see who complains. If someone misses the paperwork, ask why the document is necessary. In fact, ask, “Why?” five times to get to the root reason the document is missed. When you know the core reason for the document, see how you can satisfy that need with a streamlined process._

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Have you ever experienced the following scenario?

- Manager A asks Manager B: “How long will it take to build this software?”
- Manager B: “Well, my developers estimate 9 months with 10 full-time developers.”
- Manager A: “That’s too long. Can’t you do it faster? Maybe in 3 months?”
- Manager B: “No, 3 months is impossible.”
- Manager A: “Alright, how about 6 months then?”
- Manager B: “Still not realistic… but maybe we can manage 8 months.”
  ..._the negotiation continues_...

This is a common scenario in the software industry. The result of such conversations often defines the timeline, budget, tools, and even the teams or partners involved.  

The problem?  
Nobody focuses on finding the *right solution*. What matters is simply what gets written into the contract — and that shifts the focus away from solving the actual problem.


### So what would be the agile way ?

**Collaborate instead of negotiate!**

- Start with small, value-delivering slices for the customer.
- The customer only pays for this small piece — this is known as **Agile Contracting**. For example, they might pay for just one or two iterations to see the results.
- After each iteration, either you or the client can choose to continue or end the collaboration.
- The client can give immediate feedback and adjust the direction of the project as needed — giving them real influence over the outcome.
- This way, you're focused on **solving the actual problem**, not just fulfilling a contract.  
  **This is true collaboration!**

_**You convince with quality, not with contracts!**_

The traditional approach focuses on time and budget (the contract). But what’s the result?  
Even when projects are delivered on time and within budget, the software often fails to solve the real problem.  
In other words: **“Surgery successful, but the patient died.”**


## Responding to change over following a plan

- Plans are PREDICTIVE and Agile Working is ADAPTIVE !
- Whats the problem with plans?
  - We must predict the future and humans are really bad in predicting the future! We are just guessing and running a business based on guessing seems not to be the best way. See also _#NoEstimates_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBlnCTu9Ms
- Since the requirements will change for sure, the plan has to change too. This can happen very often. So why maintaining a plan at all when its always changing?
- Focus on changing the teams, skills and software to solve the actual problem.
- Adjusting/Adapting to the volatile needs of customer and market is the core of BEING AGILE.
- When you cannot change easily and fast to new requirements (these can affect team, skills and of course requirements of the software), you cannot fullfill the real needs of the market.

# OTHER PERSPECTIVE ON AGILE

Defintion by Dave Thomas:

1. Find out where you are
2. Take a small step towards your goal (and if there are multiple choices here, take the path of least regret, or the one that makes future change easier)
3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
4. Repeat
